# LIVE — greenlife-web (Wenatchee public site) deployment state

Last-Known-Good (LKG) deployment log per OPERATING_PRINCIPLES post-deploy verify rule.

**Canonical URL:** https://greenlifecannabis.com
**Apex + www:** middleware-redirected to canonical (per `proxy.ts`)
**Health endpoint:** /api/health
**Deploy trigger:** push to `main` (Vercel native via GitHub integration).

**Verification recipe:**

```bash
curl -fsS https://greenlifecannabis.com/api/health \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('v%s sha=%s ok=%s' % (d['version'], d['sha'], d['ok']))"
```

Verified deploy = (a) HTTP 200, (b) `ok: true`, (c) `sha` matches what was just pushed.

**Why a separate /api/health on greenlife-web** (vs reading inventoryapp's): this repo is the **customer-facing** public site (apex domain). Vercel routes apex → here → middleware redirect logic. inventoryapp serves staff at `inventoryapp-ivory.vercel.app` — different deployment. Both must be checked independently after a push that touches either.

|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-07 | v4.295 | 1e5cab6 | a11y sweep round 3 — 6 data-driven `{m.emoji}` / `{icon}` / `{CAT_ICONS}` wrappers (mood-vibe + category nav + OrderMenu + brands ×2 + about) |

## Cutover-window context (2026-05-07 → 2026-06-25)

Wenatchee customers DO NOT get a /rewards PWA on this domain — per cutover plan §6 Day 14, they only learn about the SpringBig→native transition via SMS + at the register. So during the cutover window, **greenlife-web is NOT on the critical path**. Routine polish work can continue here without affecting the cutover schedule.

Sister LIVE.md files:
- `Inventory App/LIVE.md` — staff-side inventoryapp (Wenatchee + Seattle deploys via separate Vercel projects)
- `Green Wellness/LIVE.md` — separate project, established 2026-05-06

## Rollback recipe (if a deploy lands broken)

1. Vercel dashboard → greenlife-web project → Deployments tab → find the LAST GREEN deploy from this LKG history.
2. Three-dot menu → "Promote to Production".
3. Confirm via curl that prod sha matches the rolled-back version.
4. Update LKG row noting the rollback + reason.

Greenlife-web Vercel project lives under Doug's `dougsureel-tech` account.

## Known iHeartJane integration constraint

Per memory `reference_iheartjane_jane_boost` and `feedback_diff_what_user_sees_first`: `/menu` uses iHeartJane Jane Boost embed (storeId 5294, embedConfigId 234). Apex-vs-www host matters — the CORS allowlist on iHeartJane's side binds www-host. Per `proxy.ts` the apex 308-redirects to canonical so this works correctly today; if the redirect breaks, /menu silently fails CORS with no visible error. Cost a 9-hour debugging session to discover; recovery recipe captured in `MENU_LOG.md` next to `INCIDENTS.md`.
